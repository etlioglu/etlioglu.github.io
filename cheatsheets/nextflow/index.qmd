##  Runtime

- Fetch a particular version of a pipeline:

```{.default filename="Terminal"}
nextflow pull nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.14.0`
```

- Hypens:
    - `-` for `Nextflow` options
    - `--` for pipeline-specific options
<br/><br/>  

- Find all previous runs in the current directory:

```{.default filename="Terminal"}
nextflow log
```

## Language    
    
- Variables defined by `params.` can be changed/overridden via command line arguments.

- Every function applied to a `channel` is a `channel operator`.

- `.flatten()` is the opposite of `.collect()`.

- `.view()` sends to standard output.


## Configuration

- Configuration when done within a nextflow script does not require `=`.

- Configuration when done within a config file requires `=`.

- Within a config file, whatever is within `"` and `"` are expanded. `'` can be used if expansion is not desired.
